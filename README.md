# ShadesOfGrey
This is an application that enables users to convert colored images into grey color. This tool is designed for social media users, and photographers, graphic designers, and digital artists who need a private and quick way to manipulate their images. The motivation for tool stems from my personal need for a quick and secure way to convert images to grey color without having to rely on public tools, which can often compromise privacy.
Potential users may interact with this software by selecting an image they want to convert. The application supports multiple image formats including BMP, JPG, GIF, and PNG, providing versatility to the user. Upon selection, the software processes the image, converting each pixel's color information into a grey colored equivalent, and then displays the resulting image to the user. Users have the option to save converted image.
